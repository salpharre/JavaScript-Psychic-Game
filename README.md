### General Info

This game is to be played directly in the web browser. It is a guessing game, designed for one user playing against the computer. 

The user has six chances to guess the letter, if they are not lucky enough they loose a point. Scoring is simple, you win, 1 point; you loose, 1 loss to your bag. 

Bootstrap was used for styling but the function is all JavaScript.

Sneak Peek: `if..else` conditionals nestled within a .onkeyup() function.
